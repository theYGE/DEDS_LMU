# l-Diversity and Anonymization
Every day a massive amount of data is being
collected and processed to be used for various purposes. However,
collected data contains diverse and detailed information about
individuals. So, data might have sensitive attributes which should
be protected carefully. Otherwise, attackers might access this
information and use it for unethical purposes. In this project, we
work on some strategies that are used for securing the data. We
also show our hands-on implementation on the ’adults’ dataset.
We implement k-Anonymity and l-Diversity methods to secure
the dataset and manage to reach 4 diversity and 61 anonymity
using these techniques. 

The code is structured into three parts:
1. Initial Data Augmentations focuses on prepring the dataset for k-anonimity
2. K-anonimity focuses on anonymizing dataset using k-anonimity 
3. L-diversity builds on top of k-anonimity to reach the maximum possible value of 4-anonimity in a dataset

Please, refer to the respective project report for further details.
